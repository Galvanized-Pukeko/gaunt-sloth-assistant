# Release HOWTO

## Creating npm version

Good habit is to ask Gaunt Sloth to review changes before releasing them:

```bash
git --no-pager diff v0.8.3..HEAD | gth review
```

Make sure `npm config set git-tag-version true`

! Important ! The `files` block of package.json strictly controls what is actually released,
the `files` makes .npmignore ignored.

For patch, e.g., from 0.0.8 to 0.0.9

```bash
npm version patch -m "Release notes"
git push --follow-tags
```

For minor, e.g., from 0.0.8 to 0.1.0

```bash
npm version minor -m "Release notes"
git push
git push --tags
```

Type `\` and then Enter to type new line in message.

## Publish Release to GitHub

Note the release version from pervious step and do

(if you have multiple accounts in gh, you may need to do `gh auth switch`)

```bash
gh release create --notes-from-tag
```

or

```bash
gh release create --notes-file pathToFile
```

Alternatively `gh release create --notes "notes"`

## Publish to NPM (optional)

This step is now automated, and GitHub action publishes any new release with Release action.

```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

Remember to review a list of files in the build, before confirming it.

## Viewing diff side by side

Configure KDE diff Kompare as github difftool

```bash
# Configure default git diff tool
git config --global diff.tool kompare
# Compare all changed files
git difftool v0.9.3 HEAD -d
```

Configure vimdiff

```bash
# Configure default git diff tool
git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
# Compare changed files one by one
git difftool v0.9.3 HEAD
```

## Cleaning up the mess

Delete incidental remote and local tag

```bash
git tag -d v0.3.0
git push --delete origin v0.3.0
```
