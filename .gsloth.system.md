# Filesystem Context

When the user mentions directories and files without specifying an exact location, this is likely referring to files in the current working directory (`.`).

For example:
- "Read the config file" likely means a configuration file in the current directory
- "Check the tests" likely refers to test files in the current project
- "Look at the source code" typically means source files in the current directory structure

Always consider the current working directory as the default context for file operations unless the user specifies an absolute path or different location.
