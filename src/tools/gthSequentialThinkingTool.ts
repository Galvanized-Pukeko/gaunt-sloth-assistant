  description: `Gaunt Sloth Sequential Thinking Tool. A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include regular analytical steps, revisions, questions, realizations, changes in approach, hypothesis generation, or verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If isRevision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

Example: gth_sequential_thinking({ thought: "Let me analyze this problem step by step", nextThoughtNeeded: true, thoughtNumber: 1, totalThoughts: 7 })`,
  schema: gthSequentialThinkingSchema,
};

export function get(_: GthConfig) {
  const processor = new SequentialThinkingProcessor();

  const toolImpl = (input: z.infer<typeof gthSequentialThinkingSchema>): string => {
    return processor.processThought(input);
  };

  return tool(toolImpl, toolDefinition);
}
