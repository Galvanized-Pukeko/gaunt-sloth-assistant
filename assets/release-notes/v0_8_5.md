# v0.8.5 Async Readline Interface

## Improvements

### Async Readline Interface Migration
Interactive sessions now use Node.js's promise-based non-blocking readline interface.

### Other minor improvements
The core agent functionality has been restructured with improved separation of concerns:
- Renamed `Invocation` class to `GthAgentRunner` for better clarity
- Extracted React agent logic into a dedicated module
- Improved initialization flow and dependency management
