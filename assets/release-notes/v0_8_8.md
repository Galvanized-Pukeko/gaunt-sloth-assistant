# v0.8.8 Add Manual Config

## Improvements

Now it is possible to provde path to config manually.

```bash
gth --config integration-tests/configs/groq.gsloth.config.json ask "hi"
```

This should help with running Gaunt Sloth from build pipeline.

## Potentially breaking change

Undocumented `prebuiltToolsConfig` config property renamed to `builtInToolsConfig`
