# v0.8.9 Hooks

## âœ¨ New Features

-   **Extensibility with Hooks**: A new hook system is now available for JS configurations, providing greater control over the agent's lifecycle. Developers can now implement custom logic by hooking into various stages:
    -   `createAgent`: Provide a custom agent implementation.
    -   `createRunnableConfig`: Customize the `RunnableConfig`.
    -   `beforeAgentInit` / `afterAgentInit`: Execute code before or after the agent is initialized.
    -   `beforeProcessMessages`: Intercept and modify messages before they are processed by the agent.
-   **Project level guidelines are no longer required** - warning will be issued and install dir simple guidelines are going to be used.

## ðŸš€ Enhancements

-   **Application Entry Point**: The main entry point has been changed from `index.js` to `cli.js` for clearer distinction between the executable and library code.
-   **Configuration Flag Alias**: The global `--config` flag can now be used with the shorter `-c` alias for convenience.

This with dropped requirement to project level guidelines potentially allows Gaunt Sloth
to be run from anywhere with bash command like  
```bash
gth -c ~\.ao.json chat
```
or PowerShell
```powershell
gth -c "$HOME\.ao.json" chat
```

This are considering that `.ao.json` exists in user's home dir.

## ðŸ’¥ Potentially Breaking Changes

-   **Configuration Interface Renamed**: The primary configuration interface has been renamed from `SlothConfig` to `GthConfig` (should not affect JS configs, because JS is not Typed language).
-   **Internal Refactoring**: The core `GthAgentRunner` has been substantially refactored to be more robust and to support the new hook-based architecture.
