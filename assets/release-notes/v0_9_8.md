# v0.9.8 (no) writing output to file with -wn

# write-output-to-file / writeOutputToFile / -wn

Added new config parameter `writeOutputToFile`,
which disables `This report can be found in /` feature.

Implementing #58

The default value is `true`

Can be disabled with providing `-wn` or `--write-output-to-file false` from command line or,

can be disabled from config, setting `writeOutputToFile` to `false`
```json
{
  "llm": {
    "type": "groq",
    "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"
  },
  "writeOutputToFile": false
}
```
