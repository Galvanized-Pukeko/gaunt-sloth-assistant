# v1.1.0 Custom Tools

## New Features
- **Custom Tools Configuration:** User-defined shell commands can now be configured via the `customTools` property. These tools are available across all commands (`pr`, `review`, `code`, `ask`, `chat`) by default, with per-command override and disable options.
- Commands support parameter interpolation using `${paramName}` placeholders with automatic security validation to prevent shell injection, directory traversal, and absolute path usage.
- Per-command customization allows commands to define their own `customTools` set or disable them entirely by setting `customTools: false`.

## Potentially Breaking Changes
- Removed unused `customToolsConfig` configuration property. Replaced with `customTools` which uses a properly typed structure (`Record<string, CustomCommandConfig>` instead of `Record<string, object>`).
