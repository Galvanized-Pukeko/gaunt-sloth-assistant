# v0.9.19 identity profiles

## New Features

Identity profiles are now supported.

Identity profiles can only be activated in directory-based configuration.
`gth -i devops pr PR_NO` is invoked, the configuration is pulled from `.gsloth/gsloth-settings/devops/` directory,
which may contain a full set of config files.

## Bug fix

fix #165 - Double output was written into the session file.
