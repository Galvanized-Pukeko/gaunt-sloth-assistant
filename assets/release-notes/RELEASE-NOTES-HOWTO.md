# Release notes howto

Maintain dry technical language similar to assets/release-notes/v0_8_0.md.

## Process
- Review changes from the latest tag to HEAD.
- List assets/release-notes/ and review a few recent release notes.
- Create a new release notes file for the next patch version if the user didn't specify to write release notes for minor.
  - Don't include information about unit tests, integration tests and other development-specific nuances 
- Present release notes to user and ask for confirmation
