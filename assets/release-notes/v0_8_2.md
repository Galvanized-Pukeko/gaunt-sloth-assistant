# v0.8.2 OpenAI Support and Improved CLI

## New Features

### OpenAI and Compatible Services Support
Gaunt Sloth Assistant now supports OpenAI and other services that use the OpenAI API format, such as Inception AI. This allows you to use a wider range of models with the assistant.

### Default to Chat Command
Running `gth` or `gsloth` without any arguments now defaults to starting the chat command, making it quicker to start a conversation.
