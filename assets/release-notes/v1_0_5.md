# v1.0.5 Release

## Maintenance
- Bumped dependencies, including LangChain to `^1.2.1` (middleware now requires `createMiddleware` branding).

## Documentation
- Clarified that custom middleware must be wrapped with `createMiddleware` in configuration docs and the JS config example README.

## Examples
- Refreshed the JavaScript config example to construct custom middleware via `createMiddleware`, keeping it aligned with the updated LangChain middleware branding requirements.
