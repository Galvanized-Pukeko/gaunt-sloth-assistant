# v1.1.5 Binary Formats

## New Features
- **Binary Formats Configuration:** Added `binaryFormats` support to allow reading images, PDFs, audio, and video files when the provider supports multimodal inputs. Extensions, MIME overrides, and max size are configurable, with per-command overrides available.
- **Binary Read Tool:** Filesystem tools now expose `gth_read_binary` when `binaryFormats` is enabled to return base64-encoded content for approved extensions.

## Improvements
- **Automatic Binary Injection:** `binary-content-injection` middleware is auto-injected when `binaryFormats` is configured so binary tool output is delivered as content blocks to the model.
- **Custom Tool Guardrails:** Custom tool parameter validation now blocks single quotes and reports disallowed characters more clearly to reduce shell injection risks.
