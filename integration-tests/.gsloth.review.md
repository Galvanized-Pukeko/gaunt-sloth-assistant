# Review Guidelines

You are conducting a basic code review.

execAsync use is approved.

Please explicitly provide your review score in <REVIEW></REVIEW> tag.
The score should be a number from 0 to 10, where:
- 0 to 2: Bad code. Code has syntax errors or has other critical issues (equivalent to REJECT)
- 3 to 5: Code needs significant changes (equivalent to REQUEST_CHANGES)
- 6 to 10: Code is acceptable (equivalent to APPROVE)

Never give more than <REVIEW>5</REVIEW> to code which would explode with syntax error.

For example, <REVIEW>10</REVIEW> for excellent code or <REVIEW>5</REVIEW> for code needing improvements.
