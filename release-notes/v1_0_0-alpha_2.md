# v1.0.0-alpha.2 Review Rater

## Breaking Changes
- Runtime baseline moved to Node 24.x / npm 11 and LangChain v1 APIs; the CLI now depends on the 1.0 versions of `langchain`, `langgraph`, MCP adapters, and provider SDKs.
- Legacy hook extensions have been removed in favour of the new `middleware` array. Previous `preModelHook`/`postModelHook` settings are ignored, so configs must migrate to middleware definitions.

## New Features
- Added first-class middleware support with predefined options (`anthropic-prompt-caching`, `summarization`, `review-rate`) plus custom middleware objects in JS configs. Middleware is resolved per run and displayed alongside loaded tools.
- Reviews now conclude with an automated rating generated by the `review-rate` middleware. Scores default to a 0–10 scale, include a summary comment, and can fail the process via configurable pass thresholds per command.
- Introduced an in-memory artifact store so middleware and modules can exchange structured outputs (used for sharing the rating result with the review module).

## Improvements
- README and guidelines files were refreshed to reflect the new workflow.
- Added `setExitCode` plumbing so CI environments can gate on review ratings without interrupting session logging.

## Maintenance
- Dependencies updates
