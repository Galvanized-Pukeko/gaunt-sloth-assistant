# v1.0.0 Release

## New Features
- Added first-class middleware support with predefined options (`anthropic-prompt-caching`, `summarization`) plus custom middleware objects in JS configs. Middleware is resolved per run and displayed alongside loaded tools.
- Reviews now conclude with an automated rating. Scores default to a 0–10 scale, include a summary comment, and can fail the process via configurable pass thresholds per command.
- Introduced an in-memory artifact store so middleware and modules can exchange structured outputs (used for sharing the rating result with the review module).

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed configuration merging for `pr` and `review` commands. Previously, when users defined partial command configs (e.g., setting `jira` as content provider), all default values including the `rating` config would be lost. The fix implements deep merging to properly preserve nested defaults while respecting user overrides.
- Build now correctly fails if rating is enabled but no rating artifact is present.

## Improvements
- README and documentation refreshed to reflect the new workflow.
- Added `setExitCode` plumbing so CI environments can gate on review ratings without interrupting session logging.
- Improved OAuth caching for MCP servers.
- Updated documentation for `writeOutputToFile` configuration option.

## Breaking Changes
- Runtime baseline moved to Node 24.x / npm 11 and LangChain v1 APIs; the CLI now depends on the 1.0 versions of `langchain`, `langgraph`, MCP adapters, and provider SDKs.
- Legacy hook extensions have been removed in favour of the new `middleware` array. Previous `preModelHook`/`postModelHook` settings are ignored, so configs must migrate to middleware definitions.

## Maintenance
- Dependencies updated to address potential vulnerabilities.
- Pinned `rimraf` to address CVE.
