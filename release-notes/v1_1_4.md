# v1.1.4 Recursive File Search

## Bug Fixes
- **File System Tools:** Fixed `search_files` to properly traverse subdirectories. The tool now recursively searches through the entire directory tree instead of only the immediate directory. (#225)

## Improvements
- Refactored search implementation from recursive to iterative approach for better performance and stack safety.
- Enhanced symlink handling for directories during traversal.
