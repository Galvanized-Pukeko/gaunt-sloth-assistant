# v0.9.21 Deprecation Warnings for Hooks

## Deprecation Notices

### Hooks API Deprecation
Added deprecation warnings for the hooks API in preparation for v1.0.0:
- `preModelHook` and `postModelHook` are now deprecated
- Runtime warnings are displayed when deprecated hooks are used
- Enhanced JSDoc documentation with migration guidance to middleware pattern
- Hooks will be removed in v1.0.0 following LangChain's migration to middleware

The 0.9.x release line will continue to support hooks for backward compatibility.

**Migration Path:**
- `preModelHook` → Will be replaced with middleware pattern with `beforeModel` method in v1.0.0
- `postModelHook` → Will be replaced with middleware pattern with `afterModel` method in v1.0.0

See [LangChain migration guide](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/migrate/langchain-v1) for more details.

## Maintenance

### Dependency Updates
