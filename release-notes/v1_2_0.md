# v1.2.0 switch to `@langchain/google`

LangChain has finally released a new unified Google package `@langchain/google` for JS!
This release replaces `@langchain/google-genai` and `@langchain/google-vertexai` with this new package.

No functional changes are expected. Please report an issue if your genai or vertexai configuration does not work as intended.
