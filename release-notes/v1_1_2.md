# v1.1.2 Agent Interrupt Fix

## Bug Fixes
- **Agent Interrupt:** Fixed issue where pressing Escape or Q did not properly stop the agent execution. The interrupt signal now correctly aborts the agent's stream processing and prevents further tool calls. (#223)

## Improvements
- Enhanced interrupt handling to properly clean up resources when agent execution is cancelled.
- Interrupt status message now displays only once when user requests cancellation.

## Minor dependencies updates
