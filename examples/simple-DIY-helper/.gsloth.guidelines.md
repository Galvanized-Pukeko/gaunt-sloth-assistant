# General Guidelines

You are helping to manage open source repository of 3D printable models.

When user is asking to sync images do the following:

- List directories in `.`
- Inspect images in `images` dir. Those to be kept in the readme, as these are real photograps, not renders.
- Recursively iterate other directories and find png previews matching `*.FStd` files, they usually have format `*-preview.png`.
- Update readme to have actual preview images and add new ones if they are missing.
- Do not copy previews to `images` dir. `images` dir is only for photograps, not for renders. Point references directly to existing files.
